Network Routing with Port Security and Access Control

I Configured all the devices of the network to provide better Security and to control access to the network resources.

Two subnets want to configure routing protocols to communicate with each other and share their network resources efficiently while controlling access. Here, I configured routers with OSPF routing protocol and created Access control lists to control resource access. All the switches have been configured with port security to make the network more secure.

The network is properly implemented and tested to ensure that it is functioning correctly.
